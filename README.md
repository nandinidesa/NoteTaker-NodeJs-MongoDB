The project includes the following key features:

- A basic front-end interface built with EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates to interact with the CRUD functionality. 
- Server-side code written in Node.js and Express to handle the API endpoints for the CRUD operations. 
- Integration with MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, using the Mongoose ODM (Object-Document Mapping) library to store and retrieve note data. 
- The project structure follows a typical Node.js and Express application setup, with separate directories for models, routes, and views. 1 It also includes a .env-example file to store environment variables, such as the MongoDB connection details.
